# HTTP/HTTPS protocol + TLS/SSL

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.  

## Components of HTTP-based systems
HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.

Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the response. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies, which perform different operations and act as gateways or caches, for example.

In reality, there are more computers between a browser and the server handling the request: there are routers, modems, and more. Thanks to the layered design of the Web, these are hidden in the network and transport layers. HTTP is on top, at the application layer. Although important for diagnosing network problems, the underlying layers are mostly irrelevant to the description of HTTP.

**Client: the user-agent**  
The user-agent is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser, but it may also be performed by programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their applications.

The browser is always the entity initiating the request. It is never the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to simulate server-initiated messages).

To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the page. It then parses this file, making additional requests corresponding to execution scripts, layout information (CSS) to display, and sub-resources contained within the page (usually images and videos). The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.

A Web page is a hypertext document. This means some parts of the displayed content are links, which can be activated (usually by a click of the mouse) to fetch a new Web page, allowing the user to direct their user-agent and navigate through the Web. The browser translates these directions into HTTP requests, and further interprets the HTTP responses to present the user with a clear response.

**The Web server**  
On the opposite side of the communication channel is the server, which serves the document as requested by the client. A server appears as only a single machine virtually; but it may actually be a collection of servers sharing the load (load balancing), or a complex piece of software interrogating other computers (like cache, a DB server, or e-commerce servers), totally or partially generating the document on demand.

A server is not necessarily a single machine, but several server software instances can be hosted on the same machine. With HTTP/1.1 and the Host header, they may even share the same IP address.

**Proxies**  
Between the Web browser and the server, numerous computers and machines relay the HTTP messages. Due to the layered structure of the Web stack, most of these operate at the transport, network or physical levels, becoming transparent at the HTTP layer and potentially having a significant impact on performance. Those operating at the application layers are generally called proxies. These can be transparent, forwarding on the requests they receive without altering them in any way, or non-transparent, in which case they will change the request in some way before passing it along to the server. Proxies may perform numerous functions:

- caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)
- filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)
- load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve different requests)
- authentication (to control access to different resources)
- logging (allowing the storage of historical information)

## Basic aspects of HTTP
**HTTP is simple**  
HTTP is generally designed to be simple and human-readable, even with the added complexity introduced in HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP messages into frames. HTTP messages can be read and understood by humans, providing easier testing for developers, and reduced complexity for newcomers.

**HTTP is extensible**  
Introduced in HTTP/1.0, HTTP headers make this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New functionality can even be introduced by a simple agreement between a client and a server about a new header's semantics.

**HTTP is stateless, but not sessionless**  
HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection. This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with certain pages coherently, for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets. But while the core of HTTP itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions. Using header extensibility, HTTP Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP request to share the same context, or the same state.

## HTTP and connections
A connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore fundamentally out of scope for HTTP. HTTP doesn't require the underlying transport protocol to be connection-based; it only requires it to be reliable, or not lose messages (at minimum, presenting an error in such cases). Among the two most common transport protocols on the Internet, TCP is reliable and UDP isn't. HTTP therefore relies on the TCP standard, which is connection-based.

Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response pair, they must establish a TCP connection, a process which requires several round-trips. The default behavior of HTTP/1.0 is to open a separate TCP connection for each HTTP request/response pair. This is less efficient than sharing a single TCP connection when multiple requests are sent in close succession.

In order to mitigate this flaw, HTTP/1.1 introduced pipelining (which proved difficult to implement) and persistent connections: the underlying TCP connection can be partially controlled using the Connection header. HTTP/2 went a step further by multiplexing messages over a single connection, helping keep the connection warm and more efficient.

Experiments are in progress to design a better transport protocol more suited to HTTP. For example, Google is experimenting with QUIC which builds on UDP to provide a more reliable and efficient transport protocol.

## What can be controlled by HTTP
This extensible nature of HTTP has, over time, allowed for more control and functionality of the Web. Cache and authentication methods were functions handled early in HTTP history. The ability to relax the origin constraint, by contrast, was only added in the 2010s.

Here is a list of common features controllable with HTTP:

- Caching: How documents are cached can be controlled by HTTP. The server can instruct proxies and clients about what to cache and for how long. The client can instruct intermediate cache proxies to ignore the stored document.
- Relaxing the origin constraint: To prevent snooping and other privacy invasions, Web browsers enforce strict separation between Web sites. Only pages from the same origin can access all the information of a Web page. Though such a constraint is a burden to the server, HTTP headers can relax this strict separation on the server side, allowing a document to become a patchwork of information sourced from different domains; there could even be security-related reasons to do so.
- Authentication: Some pages may be protected so that only specific users can access them. Basic authentication may be provided by HTTP, either using the WWW-Authenticate and similar headers, or by setting a specific session using HTTP cookies.
- Proxy and tunneling: Servers or clients are often located on intranets and hide their true IP address from other computers. HTTP requests then go through proxies to cross this network barrier. Not all proxies are HTTP proxies. The SOCKS protocol, for example, operates at a lower level. Other protocols, like ftp, can be handled by these proxies.
- Sessions: Using HTTP cookies allows you to link requests with the state of the server. This creates sessions, despite basic HTTP being a state-less protocol. This is useful not only for e-commerce shopping baskets, but also for any site allowing user configuration of the output.  

## HTTP flow
When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:

1. Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP connections to the servers.
2. Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple messages are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle remains the same. For example:
```GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr
```
3. Read the response sent by the server, such as:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 20:18:22 GMT
ETag: "51142bc1-7449-479b075b2891b"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 29769
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>â€¦ (here come the 29769 bytes of the requested web page)
```
4. Close or reuse the connection for further requests.
If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response to be fully received. HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with more robust multiplexing requests within a frame.

## HTTP Messages
HTTP messages, as defined in HTTP/1.1 and earlier, are human-readable. In HTTP/2, these messages are embedded into a binary structure, a frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and multiplexing. Even if only part of the original HTTP message is sent in this version of HTTP, the semantics of each message is unchanged and the client reconstitutes (virtually) the original HTTP/1.1 request. It is therefore useful to comprehend HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1 format.

There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.

**Requests**  
An example HTTP request:
![Http Request](../../assets/Http/http_request.png)  
Requests consist of the following elements:

- An HTTP method, usually a verb like GET, POST, or a noun like OPTIONS or HEAD that defines the operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using GET) or post the value of an HTML form (using POST), though more operations may be needed in other cases.
- The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from the context, for example without the protocol (http://), the domain (here, developer.mozilla.org), or the TCP port (here, 80).
- The version of the HTTP protocol.
Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers.
- A body, for some methods like POST, similar to those in responses, which contain the resource sent.

**Responses**  
An example response:
![Http Request](../../assets/Http/http_response.png)

Responses consist of the following elements:

- The version of the HTTP protocol they follow.
- A status code, indicating if the request was successful or not, and why.
- A status message, a non-authoritative short description of the status code.
- HTTP headers, like those for requests.
- Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.

## APIs based on HTTP
The most commonly used API based on HTTP is the XMLHttpRequest API, which can be used to exchange data between a user agent and a server. The modern Fetch API provides the same features with a more powerful and flexible feature set.

Another API, server-sent events, is a one-way service that allows a server to send events to the client, using HTTP as a transport mechanism. Using the EventSource interface, the client opens a connection and establishes event handlers. The client browser automatically converts the messages that arrive on the HTTP stream into appropriate Event objects. Then it delivers them to the event handlers that have been registered for the events' type if known, or to the onmessage event handler if no type-specific event handler was established.  

## HTTP Request Methods
### **CONNECT**  
The HTTP CONNECT method starts two-way communications with the requested resource. It can be used to open a tunnel.

For example, the CONNECT method can be used to access websites that use SSL (HTTPS). The client asks an HTTP Proxy server to tunnel the TCP connection to the desired destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection has been established by the server, the Proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client.

CONNECT is a hop-by-hop method.  

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | No  |
| Successful response has body | No  |
| Safe                         | No  |
| Idempotent                   | No  |
| Cacheable                    | No  |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | No  |  

### **DELETE**  

The HTTP DELETE request method deletes the specified resource.  

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | May |
| Successful response has body | May |
| Safe                         | No  |
| Idempotent                   | Yes |
| Cacheable                    | No  |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | No  |  

**Syntax**  
```
DELETE /file.html HTTP/1.1
```
**Example**  
Request  
```
DELETE /file.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```  
**Responses**  
If a DELETE method is successfully applied, there are several response status codes possible:

- A 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed but has not yet been enacted.
- A 204 (No Content) status code if the action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied.
- A 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the response message includes a representation describing the status.

```html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>File deleted.</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```  

### **GET**

The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).  

> Note: Sending body/payload in a GET request may cause some existing implementations to reject the request â€” while not prohibited by the specification, the semantics are undefined. It is better to just avoid sending payloads in GET requests.

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | No  |
| Successful response has body | Yes |
| Safe                         | Yes |
| Idempotent                   | Yes |
| Cacheable                    | Yes |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | Yes |  

**Syntax**  
```
GET /index.html
```

The HTTP HEAD method requests the headers that would be returned if the HEAD request's URL was instead requested with the HTTP GET method. **For example, if a URL might produce a large download, a HEAD request could read its Content-Length header to check the filesize without actually downloading the file.**

> Warning: A response to a HEAD method should not have a body. If it has one anyway, that body must be ignored: any representation headers that might describe the erroneous body are instead assumed to describe the response which a similar GET request would have received.

If the response to a HEAD request shows that a cached URL response is now outdated, the cached copy is invalidated even if no GET request was made.  

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | No  |
| Successful response has body | No  |
| Safe                         | Yes |
| Idempotent                   | Yes |
| Cacheable                    | Yes |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | No  |  

**Syntax**  
```
HEAD /index.html
```
### **OPTIONS**

The HTTP OPTIONS method requests permitted communication options for a given URL or server. A client can specify a URL with this method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server.  

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | No  |
| Successful response has body | Yes |
| Safe                         | Yes |
| Idempotent                   | Yes |
| Cacheable                    | No  |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | No  |  

**Syntax**  
```
OPTIONS /index.html HTTP/1.1
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
```
**Examples**  
Identifying allowed request methods
To find out which request methods a server supports, one can use the curl command-line program to issue an OPTIONS request:

```
curl -X OPTIONS https://example.org -i
```

The response then contains an Allow header that holds the allowed methods:
```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
Cache-Control: max-age=604800
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2016 11:45:00 GMT
Server: EOS (lax004/2813)
```

**Status Code**  
Both 200 OK and 204 No Content are permitted status codes, but some browsers incorrectly believe 204 No Content applies to the resource and do not send the subsequent request to fetch it.

### **PATCH**

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.

PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused).

A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. Contrast this with PUT; which is a complete representation of a resource.  

A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Contrast this with PUT; which is always idempotent. The word "idempotent" means that any number of repeated, identical requests will leave the resource in the same state. For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a PUT will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for PATCH.

PATCH (like POST) may have side-effects on other resources.

To find out whether a server supports PATCH, a server can advertise its support by adding it to the list in the Allow or Access-Control-Allow-Methods (for CORS) response headers.

Another (implicit) indication that PATCH is allowed, is the presence of the Accept-Patch header, which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.  

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | Yes |
| Successful response has body | May |
| Safe                         | No  |
| Idempotent                   | No  |
| Cacheable                    | No  |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | No  |  

**Syntax**  
```
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
```
**Example**  
**Request**  
```
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/example
If-Match: "e0023aa4e"
Content-Length: 100

[description of changes]
```  
**Response**  
A successful response is indicated by any 2xx status code.

In the example below a 204 response code is used, because the response does not carry a payload body. A 200 response could have contained a payload body.
```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /file.txt
ETag: "e0023aa4f"
```  

### **POST**

The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the Content-Type header.

The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), where successive identical POST may have additional effects, like passing an order several times.

A POST request is typically sent via an HTML form and results in a change on the server. In this case, the content type is selected by putting the adequate string in the enctype attribute of the <form> element or the formenctype attribute of the `<input>` or `<button>` elements:

- application/x-www-form-urlencoded: the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are URL encoded: this is the reason why this type is not suitable to use with binary data (use multipart/form-data instead)
- multipart/form-data: each value is sent as a block of data ("body part"), with a user agent-defined delimiter ("boundary") separating each part. The keys are given in the Content-Disposition header of each part.
- text/plain  

When the POST request is sent via a method other than an HTML form â€” like via an XMLHttpRequest â€” the body can take any type. As described in the HTTP 1.1 specification, POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:

- Annotation of existing resources
- Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar - group of articles;
- Adding a new user through a signup modal;
- Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;
- Extending a database through an append operation.  


|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-  |
| Request has body             | Yes |
| Successful response has body | Yes |
| Safe                         | No  |
| Idempotent                   | No  |
| Cacheable                    | Only if freshness information is included  |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | Yes |  

**Syntax**  
```
POST /test
```
**Example**  
A simple form using the default application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type:
```
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 27

field1=value1&field2=value2
```
A form using the multipart/form-data content type:
```
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary="boundary"

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field1"

value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field2"; filename="example.txt"

value2
--boundary--
```  

### **PUT**

The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.

The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), whereas successive identical POST requests may have additional effects, akin to placing an order several times.

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | :-: |
| Request has body             | Yes |
| Successful response has body | May |
| Safe                         | No  |
| Idempotent                   | Yes |
| Cacheable                    | No  |
| Allowed in HTML forms        | No  |  

**Syntax**  
```
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
```
**Example**  
**Request**  
```
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 16

<p>New File</p>
```
**Responses**  
If the target resource does not have a current representation and the PUT request successfully creates one, then the origin server must inform the user agent by sending a 201 (Created) response.
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Location: /new.html
```

If the target resource does have a current representation and that representation is successfully modified in accordance with the state of the enclosed representation, then the origin server must send either a 200 (OK) or a 204 (No Content) response to indicate successful completion of the request.
```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /existing.html
```
